#### 29th July 2020

YoloV4 and V5 models are trained and tested under consistent conditions of augmentations and pre-processing.
### YoloV4 and YoloV5 Training Conditions:
Mangos are annotated in their respective formats which can be accessed from YoloV4 augmented Dataset and YoloV5 augmented Dataset folders.

#### Pre-Processing:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data  
* Resizing to 416x416

#### Augmentation:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between 0 and +85 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -27 and +27 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1 percent of pixels

Here are the results obtained with their best weights.
